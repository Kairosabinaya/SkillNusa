# Fix for Firebase `auth/requires-recent-login` Error

## Problem
When users try to delete their account, Firebase throws an `auth/requires-recent-login` error because the user's authentication session isn't recent enough for sensitive operations like account deletion.

## Solution
Implemented a re-authentication flow in the account deletion process:

### 1. Updated AuthContext (`src/context/AuthContext.js`)
- Added `reauthenticateWithCredential` and `EmailAuthProvider` imports
- Created `reauthenticateUser()` function to handle password re-authentication
- Modified `deleteUserAccount()` to accept a password parameter and handle re-authentication
- Added specific error handling for `auth/requires-recent-login`

### 2. Enhanced DeleteAccountModal (`src/components/Profile/DeleteAccountModal.js`)
- Added new step (3) for re-authentication between confirmation and processing
- Added password input state and error handling
- Implemented `handleReauthAndDelete()` function to handle the re-auth flow
- Added keyboard support (Enter key) for password submission
- Improved error handling for wrong passwords

### 3. Improved userDeletionService (`src/services/userDeletionService.js`)
- Enhanced error handling in `deleteAuthUser()` method
- Added specific error messages for different auth error codes
- Better error propagation to calling code

## User Flow
1. **Warning Step**: User sees account deletion warning
2. **Confirmation Step**: User types "HAPUS AKUN SAYA" to confirm
3. **Re-authentication Step**: User enters their current password *(NEW)*
4. **Processing Step**: Account deletion proceeds with fresh authentication
5. **Result Step**: Shows success or failure message

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixes `auth/requires-recent-login` error
- ✅ Maintains security by requiring password verification
- ✅ Better user experience with clear error messages
- ✅ Handles edge cases (wrong password, network errors, etc.)
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility (Enter key support)

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Log into the application
2. Wait for the auth session to become "stale" (or modify Firebase rules to require recent login immediately)
3. Try to delete account
4. The new re-authentication step should appear
5. Enter correct password to proceed with deletion
6. Account should be deleted successfully without the `requires-recent-login` error
