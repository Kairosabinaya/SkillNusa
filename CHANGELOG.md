## [Fixed] - Freelancer Own Gig Interaction & Profile Issues

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. Freelancer Viewing Own Gigs
**Problem**: Freelancers could see and interact with action buttons (Continue, Add to Cart, Contact Freelancer) when viewing their own gigs, which could cause bugs and confusion.

**Solution**: 
- Added `isOwnGig` check in `GigDetail.js` that compares `currentUser.uid` with `gig.freelancerId`
- Implemented conditional rendering that shows different UI for gig owners:
  - **For gig owners**: Shows a management panel with "Edit Gig" and "Manage Gigs" buttons
  - **For other users**: Shows regular action buttons (Continue, Add to Cart, Contact Freelancer)
- Added validation in action handlers to prevent:
  - Adding own gig to cart
  - Purchasing own gig
  - Contacting themselves

#### 2. FreelancerProfile React Rendering Error
**Problem**: React was throwing errors about "Objects are not valid as a React child" when rendering skills with `{skill, experienceLevel}` object structure.

**Solution**:
- Fixed skills rendering in `FreelancerProfile.js` to properly handle both string and object skill formats
- Added robust parsing logic that extracts skill names from different object structures:
  - `skill.skill` (primary field)
  - `skill.name` (alternative field)
  - `skill.skillName` (alternative field)
  - Experience level display when available
- Ensured all skill data is converted to strings before rendering

#### 3. Profile Access for Freelancers
**Problem**: Freelancers reported difficulty accessing their own profiles.

**Status**: 
- Investigated the FreelancerProfile component
- Contact button is already properly hidden for own profile (`currentUser.uid !== freelancerId`)
- Skills rendering issue was likely causing the profile page to crash
- Profile access should now work correctly with the skills rendering fix

### Files Modified:
- `src/pages/GigDetail.js` - Added own gig detection and conditional UI
- `src/pages/FreelancerProfile.js` - Fixed skills object rendering
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This documentation

### Technical Details:
- **Gig Owner Detection**: Uses `currentUser.uid === gig.freelancerId` comparison
- **Skills Parsing**: Handles mixed string/object arrays with fallback extraction
- **Error Prevention**: Added early returns and error messages for invalid actions
- **UI/UX**: Provides appropriate management options for gig owners

### Testing:
1. ✅ Freelancer viewing own gig shows management options
2. ✅ Freelancer cannot add own gig to cart/checkout
3. ✅ Skills with object format render correctly
4. ✅ Freelancer profile loads without React errors
5. ✅ Contact button hidden on own profile
