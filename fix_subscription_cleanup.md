# Fix for Firestore Permission-Denied Errors During Account Deletion

## Problem
When deleting user accounts, Firestore subscription listeners were still active and trying to access data after the user was deleted from Firebase Auth, causing "permission-denied" errors.

## Root Cause
The deletion process was:
1. Delete Firestore data
2. Delete Firebase Auth user
3. ❌ Subscriptions still active trying to read data with deleted user credentials

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive subscription cleanup system:

### 1. **Pre-deletion Subscription Cleanup**
**AuthContext (`src/context/AuthContext.js`)**
- Added `cleanupSubscriptions()` function that dispatches a custom event
- Triggers cleanup BEFORE starting data deletion
- Uses `forceCleanupSubscriptions` custom event to notify SubscriptionContext

### 2. **Enhanced SubscriptionContext**
**SubscriptionContext (`src/context/SubscriptionContext.js`)**
- Added `cleanupAllSubscriptions()` function with error handling
- Listens for `forceCleanupSubscriptions` events
- Safely unsubscribes all active Firestore listeners
- Resets subscription counts to prevent UI issues

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
**userDeletionService (`src/services/userDeletionService.js`)**
- Added graceful handling for `permission-denied` errors
- Enhanced logging with emojis for better debugging
- Added delays to ensure proper cleanup sequencing
- Better error categorization (critical vs. expected)

## Updated Deletion Flow
```
🚀 Start deletion process
🧹 Clean up active subscriptions (NEW)
⏳ Wait for cleanup completion
🖼️ Delete user media
📄 Delete user-generated content  
👤 Delete user profiles
🗂️ Delete main user document
🔐 Delete auth user
✅ Complete
```

## Key Improvements

### **Subscription Management**
- ✅ Forces cleanup of all active Firestore listeners
- ✅ Uses custom events for reliable communication
- ✅ Prevents subscription leaks during deletion

### **Error Resilience**
- ✅ Gracefully handles permission-denied errors
- ✅ Distinguishes between critical and expected errors
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

### **Timing Control**
- ✅ Proper sequencing with delays
- ✅ Ensures subscriptions are cleaned before data deletion
- ✅ Prevents race conditions

## Benefits
- 🚫 Eliminates "permission-denied" errors in console
- 🔧 Cleaner user deletion process
- 📊 Better error reporting and debugging
- 🛡️ More resilient to edge cases
- 🎯 Maintains data integrity during deletion

## Testing
1. Log into application
2. Navigate around to create active subscriptions (favorites, cart, messages)
3. Initiate account deletion
4. Verify no permission-denied errors in console
5. Confirm clean deletion completion

The fix ensures that all Firestore subscriptions are properly cleaned up before the user's authentication is removed, preventing permission errors and providing a smoother deletion experience.
